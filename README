 As part of course project I implemented secure election protocol for a secured way for people to vote online using two central facilities.
 Desciption for the project:

 Voting with two central facilities

1. The CLA certifies the voters:
	Each voter sends a message to the CLA asking for a validation number 
	The CLA returns a random validation number and maintains a list of validation numbers and the corresponding recipients.
	The CLA sends the list of validation numbers to the CTF. 

2. The CTF counts the votes:
	The voters sends their vote to the CTF.
	The CTF checks the voters validation numbers against the list received from the CLA: if the validation number is valid then the vote is counted and the validation number disabled (to prevent multiple votes from the same voter).
	After all the votes are entered, the CTF publish the election results.
